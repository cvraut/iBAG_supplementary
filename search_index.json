The iBAG framework allows us to study the genomic effects from multiple types of genomic data in a hierarchical fashion. "],["intro.html", "2 Introduction", " 2 Introduction integrative Bayesian Analyses of Genomics models and its generalizations iBAG is a modeling framework for integrating multiplatform ’omic data such as genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic data along with patient-specific clinical outcomes and/or phenotypes that characterize disease development or progression (e.g. survival times, treatment arms, therapeutic response or sub-types) as well as radiological imaging data. There are four variations of iBAG methodology depending on the modeling context (as shown in the figure below) There are five versions of iBAG for specific problems: iBAG: Integrating data from multi-omic platforms (Wang et al, 2013; Jennings et al, 2013) piBAG: pathway iBAG, integrating data from multi-omic platforms + functional/pathway information (McGuffey et al, 2021+, in submission) [Forthcoming] Radio iBAG: Integrating data from multi-omic platforms + radiogologic imaging features (Zhang et al, 2019) [Forthcoming] Functional iBAG: Integrating data from high-throughput proteomics and genomics (Bhattcharyya et al, 2021+, in preparation) [Forthcoming] "],["linear-ibag.html", "3 Linear iBAG", " 3 Linear iBAG This module fits the linear iBAG models proposed in Wang et al, 2013 and Jennings et al, 2013. The model fitting and outputs are shown in the Figure below. iBAG model fitting: iBAG uses a hierarchical procedure by breaking the modeling into two parts, a mechanistic component (Step 1) that clarifies the molecular behaviors, mechanisms and relationships between and within the different types of molecular platforms. Subsequently, a clinical component (Step 2) that utilizes this information to assess associations with patient-specific clinical outcomes and/or phenotypes that characterize disease development or progression (e.g. survival times). iBAG Model Outputs: Posterior Probability Plots: Probability plots of the regression coefficients. Gene Tables: Table of genes identified to have at least one significant marker by the above posterior probability plots. Mechanistic Model Fits: A heatmap of driver genes.
