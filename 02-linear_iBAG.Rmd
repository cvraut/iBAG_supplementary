# Linear iBAG


This module fits the linear iBAG models proposed in  [Wang et al, 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23142963/) and [Jennings et al, 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23142963/). The model fitting  and outputs are shown in the Figure below. 


**iBAG model fitting**: iBAG uses a hierarchical procedure by breaking the modeling into two parts, a mechanistic component (Step 1) that clarifies the molecular behaviors, mechanisms and relationships between and within the different types of molecular platforms. Subsequently, a clinical component (Step 2) that utilizes this information to assess associations with patient-specific clinical outcomes and/or phenotypes  that characterize disease development or progression (e.g. survival times).


**iBAG Model Outputs**: 

 - `Posterior Probability Plots`: Probability plots of the regression coefficients.

 - `Gene Tables`: Table of genes identified to have at least one significant marker by the above posterior probability plots.

 - `Mechanistic Model Fits`: A heatmap of driver genes.

## Mechanistic Model

The mechanistic model uses the downstream genomic information to model the mrna expression using a GAM fit.

```{r mech_pic,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("./images/mech.png", 1))
```

*Note:* this model is fit independently across each gene. 

We can theoretically use any technique for the $f(\cdot)$ functions, but the linear iBAG makes use of Generalized Additive Models to fit the highly variable genomic data. 

$$f(X) = \sum_{j=1}^{J} \beta_j b_j(X)$$

Where $J$ is the optimal number of smoothing parameters which is determined by the GAM fit under minimised generalised cross-validation (GCV) score.

$\beta_j$ is the smoothing coefficient estimates which are estimated through GCV as well.

$b(\cdot)$ is the basis function, which in our implementation uses penalized regression splines. 

*Note:* Our mechanistic model does not estimate an intercept & we must 0-mean the mrna expression per gene.

This allows us to come up with a simple expression for calculating Sum of Squares per upstream platform & come up with a formula for Variation Explained by platform. 

$$SSTO = (E[Y]-Y)^2$$
$$SS_{Di} = SSTO - (f(X_{Di})-Y)^2$$
$$SSO = SSTO - \sum_{i=1}^{I}SS_{Di}$$

## Clinical Model

The clinical model uses the fits from the mechanistic model to relate to outcome of choice.

```{r clin_pic,echo=FALSE}
